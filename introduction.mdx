[**ScamAI**](https://www.scam.ai/) is your comprehensive platform for detecting and preventing AI-driven fraud. We offer tools (APIs)  designed to simulate, detect, and defend against modern threats like:

- **Face swaps** ‚Äì AI-generated videos where someone's face is replaced with another person's face
- **Voice clones** ‚Äì Synthetic audio that mimics a real person's voice using AI
- **Document forgeries** ‚Äì Fake or manipulated identity documents, certificates, or official papers
- **Synthetic content** ‚Äì Any media (text, images, videos, audio) created entirely by AI systems

**Simply put: We help you detect and prevent AI-generated fake content, such as videos with swapped faces or cloned voices, before they can cause harm to your business or users.**

Whether you're a:

- Security engineer building safeguards into your system  
- HR professional screening applicants for fraud  
- Developer embedding AI-integrity checks into your product  
- Founder looking to verify identity and media authenticity  

We've got you covered.

## Key Features

ScamAI is more than just a fraud detection tool ‚Äî it's a complete defence and attack stack built for the deepfake era.


üõ°Ô∏è Defence APIs

These APIs help identify and mitigate AI-generated fraud.

- **`Faceswap Detection`** ‚Äì Detect when someone's face has been digitally replaced in images or videos using AI technology.
- **`Voice Clone Detection`** ‚Äì Identify when audio has been artificially generated to sound like a specific person's voice.
- **`Document Fraud Detection`** ‚Äì Spot fake or tampered identity documents, certificates, and official papers.
- **`AI Content Detection`** ‚Äì Determine whether text, images, or videos were created by AI systems or real humans.
- **`AI Agent`** ‚Äì A conversational AI agent that receives streaming audio and context to perform real-time scam detection.

üî∫ Attack APIs

These APIs simulate threats to help you test defences and build robust systems.

- **`Faceswap Attack`** ‚Äì Generate synthetic face-swapped images for testing your detection systems or benchmarking performance.
- **`Voice Clone Attack`** ‚Äì Create voice clones from input audio to simulate potential impersonation attacks and test your defences.
