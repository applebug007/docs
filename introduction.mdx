## What is Scam AI?

**ScamAI** is your comprehensive platform for detecting and preventing AI-driven fraud. We offer tools (APIs) designed to simulate, detect, and defend against modern threats like:

- **Deepfake** ‚Äì AI-generated videos where someone's face is replaced with another person's face
- **Voice clones** ‚Äì Synthetic audio that mimics a real person's voice using AI
- **Document forgeries** ‚Äì Fake or manipulated identity documents, certificates, or official papers
- **Synthetic content** ‚Äì Any media (text, images, videos, audio) created entirely by AI systems

**Simply put: We help you detect and prevent AI-generated fake content, such as videos with swapped faces or cloned voices, before they can cause harm to your business or users.**

## Understanding AI Threats

In today's digital landscape, artificial intelligence has made it easier than ever to create convincing fake content. Understanding these threats is the first step in protecting yourself and your organization:

### 1. Deepfakes
Deepfakes are AI-generated videos or images where a person's face is replaced with someone else's face. These can be used for:
- Identity theft and impersonation
- Spreading misinformation
- Creating non-consensual content
- Fraud and social engineering attacks

### 2. Voice Cloning
Voice cloning technology can create synthetic speech that sounds like a specific person using just a few minutes of their voice. This can be used for:
- Phone-based fraud and scams
- Bypassing voice authentication systems
- Creating fake audio evidence
- Impersonating trusted individuals

## Key Features

ScamAI is more than just a fraud detection tool ‚Äî it's a complete defence and attack stack built for the deepfake era.

### üõ°Ô∏è Defence APIs

These APIs help identify and mitigate AI-generated fraud:

- **Deepfake Detection** ‚Äì Detect when someone's face has been digitally replaced in images or videos using AI technology. *Perfect for online identity verification systems, video conferencing platforms, and social media content moderation.*

- **Voice Clone Detection** ‚Äì Identify when audio has been artificially generated to sound like a specific person's voice. *Ideal for call center fraud prevention, voice-based authentication systems, and audio content verification.*

- **Document Fraud Detection** ‚Äì Spot fake or tampered identity documents, certificates, and official papers. *Essential for KYC processes, employee onboarding verification, and financial service applications.*

- **AI Content Detection** ‚Äì Determine whether text, images, or videos were created by AI systems or real humans. *Useful for content moderation, academic integrity checks, and social media authenticity verification.*

- **AI Agent** ‚Äì A real-time audio scam detection bot that listens to live conversations and identifies potential fraud attempts. *Example: During a customer service call, it can detect if the caller is using a cloned voice to impersonate an account holder.*

### üî∫ Attack APIs

These APIs simulate threats to help you test defences and build robust systems:

- **Deepfake Attack** ‚Äì Generate synthetic face-swapped images for testing your detection systems or benchmarking performance. *Useful for training your security teams and validating detection accuracy.*

- **Voice Clone Attack** ‚Äì Create voice clones from input audio to simulate potential impersonation attacks and test your defences. *Helps you understand your system's vulnerabilities before real attackers do.*
