## Key Features

ScamAI is more than just a fraud detection tool ‚Äî it's a complete defence and attack stack built for the deepfake era.


üõ°Ô∏è Defence APIs

These APIs help identify and mitigate AI-generated fraud.

- **`Faceswap Detection`** ‚Äì Detect manipulated or swapped facial images using advanced deepfake models.
- **`Voice Clone Detection`** ‚Äì Analyze audio clips for signs of synthetic manipulation.
- **`Document Fraud Detection`** ‚Äì Verify ID images for tampering or AI-generated forgeries.
- **`AI Content Detection`** ‚Äì Classify whether content was generated by AI or a human.
- **`AI Agent`** ‚Äì A conversational AI agent that receives streaming audio and context to perform real-time scam detection.

üî∫ Attack APIs

These APIs simulate threats to help you test defences and build robust systems.

- **`Faceswap Attack`** ‚Äì Generate synthetic face-swapped images for red-teaming or benchmarking.
- **`Voice Clone Attack`** ‚Äì Clone voices from input audio to simulate impersonation attempts.
