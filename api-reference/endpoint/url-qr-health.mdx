## Code Example

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8003/url-qr-health"
```

```python Python
import requests

def check_url_qr_health():
    url = "http://localhost:8003/url-qr-health"
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()

# Example usage
try:
    health = check_url_qr_health()
    print(f"Status: {health['status']}")
    print(f"Models loaded: {health['models_loaded']}")
    print(f"Uptime: {health['uptime_seconds']} seconds")

## Monitoring Tips

<Tip>
**Production Tip**
- Implement health checks as part of your application startup sequence and monitoring strategy.
- Regular health checks help ensure reliable service operation.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Service Dependencies**
- Always check that `models_loaded` is `true` before making detection requests. Requests made before models are loaded will fail.
