## How Our Detection Works

Our AI detection system uses multiple layers of analysis to identify potential threats:

### 1. Pattern Recognition
Advanced machine learning models trained on millions of samples to recognize subtle patterns that indicate artificial generation or manipulation.

### 2. Behavioral Analysis
Analysis of communication patterns, timing, and context to identify suspicious behavior typical of scam attempts.

### 3. Technical Fingerprinting
Detection of technical artifacts left behind by AI generation tools, compression algorithms, and manipulation software.

### 4. Cross-Reference Validation
Real-time checking against known threat databases and blacklists to identify previously reported scam sources.
