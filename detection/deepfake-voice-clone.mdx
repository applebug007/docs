## Understanding the Threats

### Deepfakes Explained

Deepfakes are AI-generated videos or images where a person's face is replaced with someone else's face. They're created using deep learning algorithms that can:

- **Face Swapping**: Replace one person's face with another's in videos
- **Expression Transfer**: Change facial expressions while keeping the identity
- **Age/Gender Modification**: Alter apparent age or gender characteristics
- **Full Facial Reenactment**: Control all facial movements and expressions

**Common Uses in Fraud**:
- Identity theft and impersonation
- Fake testimonials and endorsements
- Spreading misinformation
- Creating false evidence
- Social engineering attacks

### Voice Cloning Technology

Voice cloning uses AI to generate synthetic speech that sounds like a specific person. Modern voice cloning can:

- **Replicate Voice Characteristics**: Match tone, accent, and speaking patterns
- **Generate Any Text**: Make the cloned voice say anything
- **Real-time Synthesis**: Create voice clones in real-time conversations
- **Emotion Manipulation**: Add emotions not in the original recordings

**Common Uses in Fraud**:
- Phone-based scams and impersonation
- Bypassing voice authentication systems
- Creating fake audio evidence
- Business email compromise with audio "confirmation"
- Vishing (voice phishing) attacks
