## Understanding the Threats

### Deepfakes Explained
Deepfakes are AI-generated videos or images where a person's face is replaced with someone else's face. They're created using deep learning algorithms that can:

- **Face Swapping**: Replace one person's face with another's in videos
- **Expression Transfer**: Change facial expressions while keeping the identity
- **Age/Gender Modification**: Alter apparent age or gender characteristics
- **Full Facial Reenactment**: Control all facial movements and expressions

**Common Uses in Fraud**:
- Identity theft and impersonation
- Fake testimonials and endorsements
- Spreading misinformation
- Creating false evidence
- Social engineering attacks

### Voice Cloning Technology
Voice cloning uses AI to generate synthetic speech that sounds like a specific person. Modern voice cloning can:

- **Replicate Voice Characteristics**: Match tone, accent, and speaking patterns
- **Generate Any Text**: Make the cloned voice say anything
- **Real-time Synthesis**: Create voice clones in real-time conversations
- **Emotion Manipulation**: Add emotions not in the original recordings

**Common Uses in Fraud**:
- Phone-based scams and impersonation
- Bypassing voice authentication systems
- Creating fake audio evidence
- Business email compromise with audio "confirmation"
- Vishing (voice phishing) attacks

## Detection Technologies

### Deepfake Detection Methods

Our deepfake detection uses multiple advanced techniques:

- **Temporal Inconsistency Analysis**: Analyzes frame-by-frame changes to detect unnatural temporal patterns
- **Facial Landmark Detection**: Examines facial feature positioning and movement patterns for anomalies
- **Compression Artifact Analysis**: Identifies unique compression patterns left by deepfake generation algorithms
- **Biological Signal Analysis**: Detects missing or irregular biological signals like pulse and breathing
- **Neural Network Fingerprinting**: Identifies specific AI models used for generation

### Voice Clone Detection Methods

Our voice authentication system examines:

- **Spectral Analysis**: Audio frequency patterns and harmonics for synthetic generation artifacts
- **Prosodic Feature Analysis**: Speech rhythm, stress patterns, and intonation for unnatural variations
- **Glottal Flow Analysis**: Vocal cord vibration patterns that are difficult to replicate synthetically
- **Speaker Verification**: Compares voice characteristics against known authentic samples
- **Real-time Streaming Analysis**: Detects synthetic speech in live conversations
